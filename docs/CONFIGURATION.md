# Gaois.QueryLogger Configuration

The settings below can be configured to suit your particular needs. You can configure the query logger in code (ASP.NET Core only) or in your application configuration file. See the documentation for [ASP.NET Framework](https://github.com/gaois/Gaois.QueryLogger/tree/master/src/Gaois.QueryLogger) and [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/gaois/Gaois.QueryLogger/tree/master/src/Gaois.QueryLogger.AspNetCore) for implementation details in your target framework.

## Top level

**ApplicationName** (`string`): Specifies a global name for your application that can be used in all queries logged. This means that many apps can all have different application names and share the same SQL database.

**MaxQueryTermsLength** (`int?`): If set, query terms longer than the specified maximum length will be truncated.

**MaxQueryTextLength** (`int?`): If set, query text longer than the specified maximum length will be truncated.

**IsEnabled** (`bool`, default: **true**): Specifies whether the application is configured to log queries. Can be useful if you need to temporarily disable logging for any reason or if you wish to enable/disable logging based on environment variables.

**StoreClientIPAddress** (`bool`, default: **true**): Specifies whether the client IP address should be logged. The logged IP address may or may not be subsequently anonymised in part, according to the selected `AnonymizeIPAddress` setting.

**AnonymizeIPAddress** (`IPAddressAnonymizationLevel` enum, default: **IPAddressAnonymizationLevel.Partial**): Sets the level of client IP address anonymisation. The possible values are **None** (no anonymisation is applied) or **Partial** (removes the last octet of IPv4 addresses or the last 80 bits of an IPv6 address). We came to the conclusion that ‘full’ anonymisation — by means of hashing or otherwise — is not something that can be guaranteed and recommend switching the `StoreClientIPAddress` setting to false if you want to ensure that no IP data will be logged.

**AlertInterval** (`integer`, default: **300000**): The interval of time (in milliseconds) the query logger will wait between sending alerts regarding an issue with the logger service. Alerts get sent if the log queue exceeds maximum capacity or if there is an issue writing to the data store — which hopefully will never happen, but we don't want to break your inbox if it does.

## Store

**ConnectionString** (`string`): The connection string for your SQL Server data store.

**ConnectionStringName** (`string`, **ASP.NET Framework only**): The name of the connection string to use from the application’s configuration, e.g. the key of a given entry in the `ConnectionStrings` section of an application's Web.config file.

**MaxQueueSize** (`integer`, default: **1000**): The maximum possible size of the query log queue. Once the max queue size has been reached entries in the queue will be discarded on a First In, First Out basis. You should set the queue size with regard to the resources available on your system. Storing logs in queue prior to data persistence reduces the chance that you will lose data due to a passing database IOPs issue, for example.

**MaxQueueRetryInterval** (`integer`, default: **300000**): The amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait between attempts to write to the log store in the case that a connection with the store cannot be established. There may be up to `MaxQueueSize` queries in the log queue waiting to be written.

**TableName** (`string`, default: **QueryLogs**): The table name (optionally including schema), e.g. "dbo.QueryLogs" to use when logging queries. Configure this if you want to give your log table a more exotic name than "QueryLogs".

## Email

These settings, if configured, will be used to send you alert e-mails when necessary. For ASP.NET Framework applications, e-mail settings will be obtained automatically from your `mailSettings` configuration, if present, but you still need to specify a **ToAddress** here.

**ToAddress** (`string`): The address to which e-mail messages will be sent (required for alert service).

**FromAddress** (`string`): The address from which e-mail messages will be sent.

**FromDisplayName** (`string`): The display name with which e-mail messages will be sent.

**SMTPHost** (`string`): The SMTP server through which mail will be sent.

**SMTPPort** (`int?`): The port via which mail will be sent (if SMTP server is specified via `SMTPHost` above).

**SMTPUserName** (`string`): The SMTP user name to use, if authenticating.

**SMTPPassword** (`string`): The SMTP password to use, if authenticating.

**SMTPEnableSSL** (`bool`, default: **false**): Whether to use SSL when sending via SMTP.

## ExcludedIPAddresses

Queries associated with the IP addresses in this list will not be logged. Useful if, for instance, you want to prevent queries from an aggressive web crawler or scraper being logged.

**IPAddress** (`string`): The IP address to be excluded (must be a unique value).

**Name** (`string`): Labels the IP address to be excluded. The IP address is the entry key, so feel free to set the same name for multiple entries if you want to group multiple IP sources together.
